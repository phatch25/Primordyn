# Performance Improvements Summary

## Before Optimizations
- **Average Query Time**: 620ms
- **Initial Indexing**: 1321ms
- **Incremental Index**: 605ms
- **Database Size**: 1.8MB

## After Optimizations
- **Average Query Time**: 514ms (17% improvement)
- **Cached Query**: 502ms
- **Initial Indexing**: 750ms (43% improvement)
- **File Path Query**: 433ms (32% improvement)

## Optimizations Implemented

### âœ… Completed
1. **Database Optimizations**
   - Added WAL mode for better concurrency
   - Increased cache size to 64MB
   - Added memory-mapped I/O (256MB)
   - Created composite indexes for complex queries
   - Added case-insensitive index on symbol names

2. **In-Memory LRU Cache**
   - Implemented LRU cache with 30-second TTL
   - Caches query results, symbols, and files
   - Reduces repeated query time slightly

3. **Lazy Token Counting**
   - Switched from GPT-4 tokenizer to fast approximation
   - Uses 4 chars/token estimate
   - Significantly reduced overhead

4. **Connection Pooling**
   - Keeps database connection open between queries
   - Reduces connection overhead
   - Auto-closes after 5 minutes idle

## Performance Analysis

### Current Bottlenecks
1. **Query Processing Still Slow** (500ms+)
   - Complex JOIN operations
   - Full result serialization
   - Cache not persisting between CLI invocations

2. **Cache Effectiveness Limited**
   - New cache instance created each CLI run
   - Can't share cache between processes
   - Only helps within same process

3. **LIKE Queries for Aliases**
   - OR queries fall back to LIKE
   - Multiple table scans
   - No FTS5 optimization for OR

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

### High Priority
1. **Implement Process-Level Cache**
   - Use Redis or shared memory
   - Or create a daemon process
   - Would enable true sub-100ms queries

2. **Optimize Query Building**
   - Prepare statements once and reuse
   - Use query planner hints
   - Simplify JOIN operations

3. **Streaming Results**
   - Don't wait for all results
   - Stream as found
   - Progressive enhancement

### Medium Priority
1. **Better FTS5 Usage**
   - Fix OR query construction
   - Use FTS5 for more query types
   - Optimize relevance scoring

2. **Parallel Query Execution**
   - Search files and symbols in parallel
   - Use worker threads
   - Async database operations

## Conclusion

We achieved a **17% performance improvement** in average query time and **43% improvement** in indexing speed. However, the 514ms average query time is still above the 100ms target for truly responsive interaction.

The main issue is that each CLI invocation creates a new process with fresh caches. To achieve sub-100ms queries, we need either:
1. A persistent daemon process with warm caches
2. Shared memory or Redis cache
3. Much simpler query structure

The tool is now functional and somewhat faster, but still needs architectural changes for truly fast performance.
