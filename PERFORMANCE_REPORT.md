# Primordyn Performance Report

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive performance testing reveals that Primordyn performs adequately for small-to-medium codebases but has significant performance issues that need addressing. Query times average 500-600ms, which is too slow for interactive use.

## Test Environment
- **Codebase**: Primordyn itself (47 files, 394 symbols, 78,763 tokens)
- **Database Size**: 1.8MB SQLite database
- **Platform**: Linux
- **Test Date**: 2025-08-22

## Performance Metrics

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Incremental Indexing**: 605ms (acceptable for no changes)
2. **Database Size**: 1.8MB is reasonable for the codebase size
3. **Special Character Handling**: 225ms (fast fallback to LIKE queries)

### ❌ Critical Issues

1. **Query Performance**: Average 620ms per query is TOO SLOW
   - Target should be <100ms for interactive use
   - Current performance makes the tool feel sluggish

2. **Initial Indexing**: 1321ms is acceptable but could be faster

3. **Search Reliability Issues**:
   - Basic symbol search returns null results
   - Fuzzy search not finding obvious matches
   - File path search unreliable
   - Multi-word search failing
   - Language filters not working properly

## Detailed Test Results

| Test | Time (ms) | Status | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Initial Indexing | 1321 | ⚠️ OK | Could be optimized |
| Incremental Index (no changes) | 605 | ✅ Good | Fast enough |
| Basic Symbol Search | 632 | ❌ SLOW | Returns null |
| Fuzzy Search | 579 | ❌ SLOW | Not finding matches |
| File Path Search | 637 | ❌ SLOW | Unreliable |
| Alias Expansion | 614 | ❌ SLOW | Working but slow |
| Large Token Query | 519 | ⚠️ OK | Retrieved 21672 tokens |
| Multi-word Search | 566 | ❌ SLOW | Not finding results |
| Language Filter | 520 | ❌ SLOW | Returns 0 results |
| Symbol Type Filter | 230 | ✅ OK | But returns empty |
| Complex Alias | 573 | ❌ SLOW | Working but slow |
| Special Characters | 225 | ✅ Good | Fast fallback |
| **Average Query Time** | **620** | **❌ CRITICAL** | Must be <100ms |
| Auto-refresh Query | 1629 | ⚠️ OK | Expected for refresh |

## Root Causes Analysis

### 1. **Database Query Optimization**
- No query result caching beyond 15-minute cache
- Complex JOIN operations in every query
- Full table scans for LIKE queries with OR conditions
- Missing indexes on frequently queried columns

### 2. **JSON Parsing Overhead**
- Every query includes full JSON output formatting
- Large result sets being serialized even when not needed

### 3. **Token Counting**
- Using GPT-4 tokenizer for every result
- Token counting happens synchronously in query path

### 4. **Search Algorithm Issues**
- FTS5 not being used effectively
- Fallback to LIKE too frequent
- Fuzzy search loading 1000 symbols into memory

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

1. **Add Query Result Caching**
   - Implement in-memory LRU cache for recent queries
   - Cache for 30 seconds (queries rarely change that fast)
   - Expected improvement: 90% reduction for repeated queries

2. **Optimize Database Indexes**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_symbols_name_lower ON symbols(LOWER(name));
   CREATE INDEX idx_files_language ON files(language);
   CREATE INDEX idx_symbols_type ON symbols(type);
   ```

3. **Fix Search Reliability**
   - Debug why basic searches return null
   - Fix FTS5 query construction
   - Improve fuzzy matching algorithm

4. **Lazy Token Counting**
   - Only count tokens when needed (not for JSON format)
   - Cache token counts in database

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Query Parallelization**
   - Run file and symbol searches in parallel
   - Use worker threads for heavy operations

2. **Smarter FTS5 Usage**
   - Better query escaping
   - Use FTS5 prefix queries properly
   - Optimize BM25 scoring

3. **Connection Pooling**
   - Keep database connection open between queries
   - Use WAL mode for better concurrency

### Long-term Optimizations

1. **Consider Alternative Search Engine**
   - Evaluate tantivy or MeiliSearch for better performance
   - Consider using a dedicated search service

2. **Incremental Result Streaming**
   - Stream results as they're found
   - Don't wait for all results before returning

3. **Background Index Updates**
   - Move indexing to background thread
   - Use file watchers for real-time updates

## Validation Errors Found

1. Search term validation too strict (rejecting "." query)
2. FTS5 syntax errors with special characters
3. Empty results for valid queries

## Memory Usage
- Database size: 1.8MB (acceptable)
- No memory leaks detected
- Could benefit from connection reuse

## Conclusion

**Current State**: The tool works but is too slow for productive use. The 620ms average query time makes it feel unresponsive.

**Target State**: Queries should complete in <100ms for instant feedback. This requires significant optimization work.

**Priority Actions**:
1. Fix search reliability issues (queries returning null/empty)
2. Add aggressive caching
3. Optimize database indexes
4. Fix validation errors

The alias system works well but inherits the underlying performance issues. Once base performance is fixed, the alias expansion will also benefit.
